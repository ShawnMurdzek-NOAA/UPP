CRTM Fix Files
--------------

On Jet, use fix files in /lfs1/BMC/nrtrr/FIX_EXEC_MODULE/crtm/CRTM_v2.2.6/


Control Text Files (Flat Text Files)
------------------------------------

For WRF simulations, I recommend using parm/postxconfig-NT-hrrr.txt


Working on GitHub
-----------------

Push changes to the release/upp_v11.0.0 branch. I prefer this branch b/c it is a stable release,
rather than the development branch
